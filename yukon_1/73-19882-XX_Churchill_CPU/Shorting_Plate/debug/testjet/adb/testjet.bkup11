! The customizable parameters were:
!     LowestLowLimit   2.0
!     MinCpk           2.5
!     HiPercent        2.0
!     HiMinOffset      20.0
!     LowPercent       0.50
!     LowMinOffset     10.0
!
! These parameters can be modified by editing the file:
!   debug/testjet/adb/CustomParameters.txt
!   This can also be done from the AutoDebug menu.
