! Part Name:         24C64
! Alias:             24C65
! Part Type:         VLSI
! Description:       64K Bit (8K X 8) Serial EEPROM
! Manufacturer:
! Package Style:     8 pin SOC
! Created:           Sep 27, 2002
! Updated:           Apr 19, 2006. Updated tests for pin WP.
! Programmer:        sama
! Tester:            HP3070
! Processor:         VPU
! Vector Format:     VCL
! Fault coverage:    100%, Pin test only
!                          To test pin 7, WP, memory location $1FFF will be
!                          over-written. If this is not allowed, the test
!                          units for pin 7, WP, should be deleted.
! Constraints:       No
! Cisco Part #:      16-2242-01,16-2344-01
