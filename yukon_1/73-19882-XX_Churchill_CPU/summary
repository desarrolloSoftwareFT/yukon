     SUMMARY STATISTICS
 
        For precision nodes:
 
            The average BRC to probe distance is 3.404.
            The standard deviation is 2.269.
 
            * precision nodes include critical nodes, digital 
              nodes, and analog nodes using external 
              instrumentation or the time interval counter
 
        For all nodes:
 
            The assignment used 2650 interface pins for 2087 nodes.
            The efficiency is 0.788.

Check the fixture file, the old wirelist, and the test sources to make sure 
that the node names are correct.  Make sure that the appropriate .r files 
exist. (WARNING MPA404)
